A sample script for Chinedu

The script uses ES6, still trying to fiure out what that means.
But so far it means we cannot just run the html file in a broswer by clicking on it or opening it from the 
chrome file menu.
We have to actually run it from a web server.

I think you can use something called simple server in vscode.

but i just openied a command prompt in the folder that conatins index.html and ran

python3 -m http-server 8001

this starts a webserver using the current directory as its home and then the project can be accesed  by pointing my web browser to

http://localhost:8001
